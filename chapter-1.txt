Operating System acts as an interface between user and the hardware.

Resource manager:perform allocation and deallocation of resources
  They are divided into hardware and software
  Hardware:CPU, monitors, I/O devices.
  Software:files, semaphores , monitors.
Control programs:control all the operations of the programs

Goals:Convinience- primary goal
      Efficiency
      Relaible- purpose acheived
      scalable
      Robust
      Portable
Functions: Processer management
           Memory management
           Error detection
           Security
           File management
Components of hardware: Input
                        ouptut
                        CPU : memory unit: primary(main) -volatile ,secondary(auxilary) - non-valatile
                              control unit
                              arithmetic logic unit
Test.c -> compiler -> instructions -> load exe file from hard disk to main memory 
Types of Operating System: Batch Operating System
                           Distributed Operating System
                           Network Operating System
                           Real-time Operating System
                           Time Sharing Operating System
                           Multi- programming Operating System
Uni-programming : hold single program in memory
    drawback:less effciency
